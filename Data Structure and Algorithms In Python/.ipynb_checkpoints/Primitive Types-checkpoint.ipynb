However, when computing the parity of a collection of bits, it does not matter how we group those bits, i.e., the computation is associative. Therefore, we can compute the parity of a 64-bit integer by grouping its bits into four nonoverlapping 16 bit subwords, computing the parity of each subwords, and then computing the parity of these four subresults. We choose 16 since 216 = 65536 is relatively small, which makes it feasible to cache the parity of all 16-bit words using an array. Furthernore, since 16 evenly divides 64`\n",

To get the last two bits after the right shift by 4, we bitwise-AND (00001110) with (0000001 1) (this is the \"mask\" used to extract the last 2 bits). The result is (00000010).

We repeat the same operation on32-,16-,8-, 4-, 2-, and 1-bit operands to get the final result. Note that the leading bits are not meaningful, and we have to explicitly extract the result from the least-significant bit. We illustrate the approach with an 8-bit word. The parity of (11010111) is the same as the parity of (1101) XORed with (0111), i.e., of (1010). This in tum is the same as the parity of (10) XORed with (10), i.e., of (00). The final result is the XOR of (0) with (0), i.e.,0, Note that the first XOR yields (11011010), and only the last 4 bits are relevant going forward. The second XOR yields (11101100), and only the last 2 bits are relevant. The third XOR yields (10011010). The last bit is the result, and to extract it we have to bitwise-AND with (00000001).`\n"
